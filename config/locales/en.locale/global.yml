    <h3>Searching on Datanest</h3>
    <p>On Datanest, you can search for businesses, people, titles of orders, subsidised projects and various other items related to the use of public money.</p>
    <p>In addition to basic search, you can use advanced search, which allows filtering with several criteria simultaneously. Filtering works much like in Excel - you can filter by entering the name of the dataset and by adding a filter through "Advanced Search".</p>
    <p>Try searching for: <a href="/searches/quick?query_string=Siemens">Siemens</a>, <a href="/searches/quick?query_string=Granvia">Granvia</a>, <a href="/searches/quick?query_string=Skytoll">Skytoll</a></p>
